The 5 ksec Chandra HRC-I\\nimage provides the first direct evidence for spatially extended X-ray emission\\nin an early-type binary system. The X-ray emission peaks close to the position\\nof the radio bow shock and north of the WN8 star. A deeper X-ray image is\\nneeded to accurately determine the degree of spatial extension, to exactly\\nalign the X-ray and optical/radio frames, and to determine whether part of the\\ndetected X-ray emission arises in the individual stellar winds. Simulated X-ray\\nimages of the wind-wind collision have a FWHM consistent with the data, and\\nmaximum likelihood fits suggest that a deeper observation may also constrain\\nthe inclination and wind momentum ratio of this system. However, as the WR wind\\ndominates the colliding wind X-ray emission it appears unlikely that the\\nmass-loss rate and the terminal velocity of the companion wind can be\\nseparately determined from X-ray observations.

In this study, images were taken from ISIC 2017 Challenge. The skin cancer images taken were preprocessed and data augmented. Later, these images were trained with transfer learning and fine-tuning approach and deep learning models were created in this way. 3 different mobile deep learning models and 3 different batch size values were determined for each, and a total of 9 models were created. Among these models, the NASNetMobile model with 16 batch size got the best result. The accuracy value of this model is 82.00%, the precision value is 81.77% and the F1 score value is 0.8038.

Observations rule out some axion-like particles in the quest for the content of dark matter. The article is now published in the Physical Review Letters. [15] Scientists have detected a mysterious X-ray signal that could be caused by dark matter streaming out of our Sun's core. Hidden photons are predicted in some extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics, and unlike WIMPs they would interact electromagnetically with normal matter. In particle physics and astrophysics, weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs, are among the leading hypothetical particle physics candidates for dark matter. The gravitational force attracting the matter, causing concentration of the matter in a small space and leaving much space with low matter concentration: dark matter and energy. There is an asymmetry between the mass of the electric charges, for example proton and electron, can understood by the asymmetrical Planck Distribution Law. This temperature dependent energy distribution is asymmetric around the maximum intensity, where the annihilation of matter and antimatter is a high probability event. The asymmetric sides are creating different frequencies of electromagnetic radiations being in the same intensity level and compensating each other. One of these compensating ratios is the electron – proton mass ratio. The lower energy side has no compensating intensity level, it is the dark energy and the corresponding matter is the dark matter.\n","\n","researches at stockholm university are getting closer to light dark - matter particle models . observations rule out some axion - like particles in the quest for the content of dark matter . the article is now published in the physical review letters . [ 15 ] scientists have detected a mysterious x - ray signal that could be caused by dark matter streaming out of our sun ' s core . hidden photons are predicted in some extensions of the standard model of particle physics , and unlike wimps they would interact electromagnetically with normal matter . in particle physics and astrophysics , weakly interacting massive particles , or wimps , are among the leading hypothetical particle physics candidates for dark matter . the gravitational force attracting the matter , causing concentration of the matter in a small space and leaving much space with low matter concentration : dark matter and energy . there is an asymmetry between the mass of the electric charges , for example proton and electron , can understood by the asymmetrical planck distribution law . this temperature dependent energy distribution is asymmetric around the maximum intensity , where the annihilation of matter and antimatter is a high probability event . the asymmetric sides are creating different frequencies of electromagnetic radiations being in the same intensity level and compensating each other . one of these compensating ratios is the electron - proton mass ratio . the lower energy side has no compensating intensity level , it is the dark energy and the corresponding matter is the dark matter .\n","--------------------\n","  In this manuscript, we present a robust method for glaucoma screening from\n","fundus images using an ensemble of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
